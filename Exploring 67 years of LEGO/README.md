Project Description

Everyone loves Lego (unless you ever stepped on one).Did you know by the way that "Lego" was derived from the Danish phrase leg godt, which means "play well"? Unless you speak Danish, probably not.

In this project, simple data analysis is done, on a dataset provided by Rebrickable(https://rebrickable.com/downloads/).

The Rebrickable database includes data on every LEGO set that ever been sold; the names of the sets, what bricks they contain, what color the bricks are, etc. It might be small bricks, but this is big data!
